# Set Items
# Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.


# Unordered
# Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

# Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

# Unchangeable
# Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

# thisset[1]="z"
# print(thisset)
