# Tuple
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.



# One item tuple, remember the comma:


thisTuple=('apple', 'boy', 'cat')
# print(thisTuple)


thisTuple2=('apple', 'boy','cat', 'dog', 'apple', 'boy')
# print(thisTuple2)

#  len function remain same

# print(len(thisTuple2))


# One item tuple, remember the comma: // if not comma then its str not tuple
onetuple=('apple',) 
# print(type(onetuple))
# print(onetuple)

tuple1=['a', 'b', 'c']
tuple2=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
tuple3=[True, True, False]

# print(tuple1)
# print(tuple2)
# print(tuple3)



mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# print(type(mytuple))



my=tuple((1,2,3,4,5))
print(type(my))
print(my)
